					<h4 class="keyTitle">ABOUT TRU TIME</h4>
					<p>Our team of experts have reviewed thousands upon thousands of chargebacks and in doing so we have discovered very specific errors in the way lenders have instructed Dealers to cancel their products due to repossessions and total losses.  We have created an innovative and proprietary software that reviews each chargeback in Tru-Time along with applicable federal and specific state laws to maximize your monthly chargeback savings! </p><br>
					<p>We understand how busy your back office can be which is why we have streamlined the process to save them time and you money.   You will have direct access to your very own software that will give you instant results and with the maximum amount of savings. </p><br>
					<p>We are always here; in some cases, we will request additional information from the lender prior to cancelling to insure you are cancelling correctly and are maximizing your savings. </p><br>
					<p>Our software has many other benefits for you and your team.  You will now have digital records (Tru-Record) of each chargeback and can monitor your savings daily. </p><br>
					<p>You are probably asking yourself at this point, how this effects your relationship with your lender partners.  In the thousands of chargebacks, we have processed we have not had a single relationship questioned.   As a matter of fact, once the Lender realizes that you have DCS on your side, they start doing things the way they should have been. </p><br>
					<p>This has been a practice and profit center for Lenders for years.  DCS is now putting that money back into the Dealers hand, where it belongs.</p> <br>
					<p style="font-weight: bold">With a one store group we have seen savings over $80,000 in a year on repossession and total loss’s alone.  </p><br>
					<p>With the Tru-Time technology we can start saving you money immediately and collect all the data needed to initiate your Tru-Review collection process.  Imagine hundreds of thousands per year, back to your Dealership!! </p>
