							<p>We’ve reviewed thousands of chargebacks, so we know the specific errors lenders make when instructing dealers to cancel their products due to  repossessions and total losses. It’s because of this experience that we’ve  been able to build innovative software that reviews each chargeback in Tru Time, along with the applicable federal and specific state laws to maximize  your monthly chargeback savings!</p><br>
							<p>We understand how busy your back-office can be, which is why we have  streamlined the process to save them time and you money. You will have  direct access to your very own software that will give you instant results with the maximum amount of savings. In some cases, we may request  additional information from the lender prior to cancelling, just to ensure you  are cancelling correctly and maximizing your savings.</p><br>
							<p>Our software has many other benefits for you and your team. You willhave  digital records (Tru-Record) of each chargeback so you can monitor your  savings daily.</p><br>
							<p>Wondering how this affects your relationship with your lenders? In the  thousands of chargebacks we have processed, we have not had a single  relationship questioned. As a matter of fact, once the lender realizes that  you have DCS on your side, they start doing things properly.This has been  a practice and profit center for lenders for years. DCS is now putting that  money back into the dealers’ hands, where it belongs.</p><br>

							<p style="font-weight: bold">With one store we have seen savings of over $80,000 in a year on  repossession and total losses alone. </p><br>
							<p>With Tru-Time technology we can start saving you money immediately and  collect all the data needed to initiate your Tru-Review collection process.  Just imagine, hundreds of thousands per year back to your dealership!! </p>
