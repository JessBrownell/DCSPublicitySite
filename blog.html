					<h4 class="keyTitle" style="color: grey;">Santander’s $550 Million Settlement; Still No Good for Dealerships</h4>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="card">
					<p>This year hasn’t been any beneficial in economic terms for any business, but the dealerships have suffered more than what they expected. Here we have “Tait dealership’s sorrows” of how Santander provided them with no breathing space. “I expected to make a healthy profit when Santander approved sub-prime loans for my low-income customers, but I had no idea of how the profit for the day would cause mass losses for tomorrow”. The story had been the same for every dealership that dealt with Santander</p><br>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Santander and It’s Predatory Policymaking</p><br>
					<p>Meanwhile, Santander Consumer USA, the nation’s largest subprime auto financing company, gained the better of customers by approving high-cost loans to them, which they failed to repay. The loans approved by Santander Bank were larger than the borrower’s entire income, and interest would often surpass the principal amount. These loans included higher interest rates, larger monthly payments, and significant backend fees that resulted in low credit score and turned the borrowers into defaulter, which led to repossession of vehicles.</p>
					<p>Dealerships have suffered massively due to the predatory policing, they lost the commission-related profit and had to face the wrath of disappointed customers, who hold them responsible for inadequate loan management.  Moreover, Santander also misled borrowers about their rights, risks of partial payments and loan extensions. All of this led to legal suit being signed against the bank, which bought compensating results for the borrowers.</p><br>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Terms of the Settlement</p><br>
					<p>Santander Bank has reached a $550 million settlement with 33 states of the USA including the New Mexico, New York, California, and New Hampshire. Santander agreed to pay $65 million to consumers who have defaulted on loans between Jan. 1, 2010 to  Dec. 31, 2019. The remaining $433 million would go towards loan forgiveness, including funds for customers who have had their cars repossessed. However, no form of compensation has been offered to the dealerships, who were the intermediary between the two parties.</p><br>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why the Settlement Creates Little-to-No Good for Dealerships?</p><br>
					<p>The 550 million settlement is nothing more than a “lollipop” to prevent dealerships from any flout against the bank. Santander hasn’t accepted its immoral and predatory practices or offered an apology, but have just settled on a low to keep the favors with them. Along with it, as the dealers play a major part in arranging loans, the credit problems has led to defamation of the dealerships, that leads to lesser customers for the future. In addition to it, Santander in their official statement mentioned about a dealer’s misconduct, hence adding to the defamation for the dealers.</p><br>
